					<h2>About</h2>
				</header>

				<p>
					I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at Purdue University.
					My work has involved <b>satellite image change detection</b>, multivariate <b>time-series forecasting on sensor data</b>,
					and <b>model compression for edge AI.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Although AI and machine learning have become increasingly prominent, modern models <b>remain
					inefficient for real-world edge deployment</b>. Large-scale systems such as ChatGPT require
					significant computational power, memory, and energy, making them difficult to deploy in
					resource-constrained environments. Engineers need to make things more efficienct - This is the reason behind my interest in model compression and
					efficient learning strategies that preserve performance while reducing computational cost.
				</p>


				<p>
					At the same time, I believe we still lack a fundamental understanding of how models should
					learn and reason about information over time (in other words, temporal reasoning). While many methods exist for temporal modeling,
					truly understanding dynamic scenes and evolving visual content remains an open problem.
					Through my research, I aim to contribute toward building models that better capture temporal
					structure and can be deployed effectively on edge devices.
				</p>
        <p>
					Overall, I try to build <b>efficient and interpretable models</b> that can operate reliably in real-world environments.

    <h2>Problems I’m Interested In</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    My research interests are driven by fundamental problems that arise when deploying learning-based systems
    in real-world, resource-constrained, and temporally evolving environments. Rather than focusing solely on
    model performance in isolation, I am interested in understanding <b>why models fail</b>, <b>what information
    they rely on</b>, and <b>how they can be made more efficient, interpretable, and reliable</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One major problem I care about is <b>efficient learning under limited computational budgets</b>. Modern deep
    learning models are often over-parameterized and expensive, making them unsuitable for edge deployment.
    I am interested in identifying which components of a model are truly necessary, how redundancy can be reduced,
    and how inductive structure can be imposed without sacrificing performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another core challenge is <b>temporal reasoning and dependency modeling</b>. Many real-world systems—such as
    satellite imagery streams and multivariate sensor data—exhibit complex temporal dependencies that are not
    well captured by static models. I am interested in understanding how information propagates over time,
    how causality and influence can be disentangled across channels, and how models can learn meaningful temporal
    representations rather than short-term correlations.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am also interested in the problem of <b>change understanding</b>, particularly in visual data. Beyond detecting
    whether a change has occurred, I care about understanding <b>what changed</b>, <b>where it changed</b>, and
    <b>why that change is meaningful</b>. This includes problems such as separating semantic changes from nuisance
    factors like illumination or seasonal variation, and guiding models to focus on informative regions rather than
    background noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, I am interested in <b>bridging classical signal processing with modern learning-based approaches</b>.
    Many inverse problems and decomposition-based formulations offer interpretability and theoretical grounding
    that purely data-driven models lack. I am motivated by problems where combining these perspectives can lead
    to more robust, explainable, and controllable systems.
